# PersonalFinanceApp

Here is what we did in this branch:

- The first step we took was to specify the type of data our application needs. 
- This was done by creating classes in the `Model` folder.
- Each Model Class represents a table in our database.
- We created an `Expenses` class with the properties:   
    - `id`: a unique identifier for each expense
    - `description`: a description of the expense
    - `amount`: the amount of the expense
    - `category`: teh category the expense falls under
    - `date`: the date of the expense
